- Gitleaks credential scanning

### Quality Status (Updated: 2025-10-02)

📊 **Quality Metrics from Comprehensive Review:**
- **Scripts Analyzed:** 42 representative samples from 772 total
- **High Quality Scripts:** ~30% (confirmed excellent)
- **Scripts Needing Improvement:** ~65-70%
- **Critical Issues:** ~30% of scripts

⚠️ **Known Issues Being Addressed:**

**CRITICAL Priority:**
- Incorrect `[string]` type casting on object variables (~30% of scripts)
- Hardcoded customer/subscription values (security risk)
- Broken syntax in several scripts

**HIGH Priority:**
- Malformed help documentation (missing closing tags, syntax errors)
- Missing or incorrectly placed `[CmdletBinding()]` attributes

**MEDIUM Priority:**
- Missing parameter validation
- Inconsistent error handling
- Missing module requirements

See [QUALITY_REVIEW.md](QUALITY_REVIEW.md) for complete quality analysis.

## Team Assignments

Scripts divided into 3 equal groups for parallel remediation:

**Team Member 1:** Scripts 1-258
- ai, backup, compute, cost, devops, identity, integration, iot, migration, monitoring (partial)

**Team Member 2:** Scripts 259-516
- monitoring (remaining), network, security, storage (partial)

**Team Member 3:** Scripts 517-772
- storage (remaining), utilities
